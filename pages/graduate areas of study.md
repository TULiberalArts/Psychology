## Clinical Psychology

The Clinical Psychology Program at Temple University subscribes to the clinical scientist model and provides sound, rigorous training in clinical and research methodologies. The overarching mission of the program is to train creative and accomplished clinical scientists who produce, consume, and disseminate psychological science and who function successfully in academic, research, and applied settings. Doctoral students receive broad-based training in preparation for careers as researchers, educators, and scientifically minded clinicians. Coursework provides students with a solid theoretical and scientific foundation in the core areas of psychology and essential aspects of clinical psychology.

Students are immersed in the conduct of research in clinical psychology and its application to the assessment and treatment of persons with mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Many of our students conduct research with applied emphases, and they are encouraged to incorporate empirical research directly into their assessment, intervention, and treatment planning. For graduates who choose an academically or research-oriented career path, it is our goal that their research endeavors be informed by a fundamental understanding of basic psychological science, including psychopathology and a solid foundation of clinical skill and experience in the assessment and treatment of persons with psychological, emotional, and behavioral disorders.

For students who go on to do work that is more clinical in nature, our goal is that these graduates not only bring excellence, professionalism, and leadership to their clinical work, but that they do so within a scientific framework. As we define it, this means that they bring the perspectives and habits of scientific inquiry into their clinical work and that their work is continually informed by advances in the scientific literature. To accomplish these goals, Temple students are directly involved in both research and clinical training throughout their tenure, beginning in their very first year.

The Clinical Psychology Program is fully accredited by the Psychological Clinical Science Accreditation System (PCSAS) and the American Psychological Association (APA).

### Goals of Clinical Psychology

The goals of the clinical psychology Ph.D. training program are:

- Develop clinical psychologists who have a broad understanding of the knowledge base and theoretical and methodological foundations in psychology, and more specifically, in the field of clinical psychology.

- Develop clinical psychologists who possess the knowledge and skills to conduct high quality and ethical research and make meaningful contributions to the empirical and theoretical literature in clinical psychology.

- Develop clinical psychologists who are competent in the practice of clinical psychology and are skilled in the ethical application of empirically supported principles and techniques of assessment and intervention in their professional activities.

- Develop clinical psychologists who seek to integrate science and practice in their research and clinical activities.

The overarching goal of the program is to train creative and competent scientists and practitioners who are producers and consumers of knowledge in psychological science and will be competent to function successfully in academic, research, and clinical settings.  Some of our students go on to do work that is largely clinical in nature upon completion of their degrees.  It is our goal that these graduates not only bring excellence, professionalism, and leadership to their clinical work, but that they do so within a scientific framework.  As we define it, this means that they bring the perspectives and habits of scientific inquiry into their clinical work and that their work is continually informed by advances in the scientific literature.  For instance, these graduates should be well versed in the application of empirically supported treatments for psychological, emotional and behavioral disorders. Likewise, for the increasing numbers of graduates who choose an academically or research-oriented career path, it is our goal that their research endeavors are informed by a fundamental understanding of psychopathology and a solid foundation of clinical skill and experience in the assessment and treatment of persons with psychological, emotional and behavioral disorders.  To accomplish these goals, Temple students are directly involved in both research and clinical training throughout their tenure, beginning in their very first year.

## Developmental Psychology

The Developmental Psychology Area comprises a group of faculty and doctoral students who are addressing questions involving cognitive, social, or emotional development within and across various phases of the life cycle. The rationale for our graduate training program is the core assumption that the consideration of developmental processes is a invaluable part of understanding any psychological phenomenon.

Although developmental students often specialize in one phase of development and a particular content area, each student is encouraged to explore the general nature of the change process across the lifespan. With that goal in mind, developmental students take graduate courses on a variety of topics, including the option to pursue advanced statistical training.

Each student also works closely with a faculty advisor to develop a programmatic line of research which would provide a foundation for obtaining a postdoctoral position. There is a strong emphasis on presenting work at major academic conferences as well as publishing in top peer-reviewed journals.

For more details, prospective applicants are encouraged to explore the web pages of developmental faculty (below) to get a closer look at the research topics that are being explored across the area. Envisaging a good fit between an applicant’s research interests and those of a specific developmental faculty member is a very important aspect of the admissions process.

Students also have the option of taking a concentration in Developmental Psychopathology. Learn more about the concentration in Developmental Psychopathology.

**Developmental Psychopathology Concentration**

In recognition of the growing popularity of the area of developmental psychopathology, the department provides graduate students the option of pursuing a concentration in Developmental Psychopathology as part of their graduate training. The concentration in Developmental Psychopathology is neither a separate program nor a subdivision of any of the specific programs (e.g., clinical, developmental), but an approach to coursework, research, and other graduate activities that reflects a developmental psychopathology framework. There are a variety of ways that students can meet criteria for the Developmental Psychopathology concentration.

**Coursework**

All students interested in the Developmental Psychopathology concentration should meet the requirements of their individual programs and plan electives to ensure that the following courses are taken:

- developmental psychopathology
- core course in developmental psychology
- core course in psychopathology
- one additional elective in developmental psychology
- one additional elective in clinical psychology
- advanced statistics beyond multivariate regression

**Research**

Students’ independent research (e.g., dissertation) should reflect the application of a developmental psychopathology perspective in the research questions, methods, analytic approach, and interpretation of findings. At least one of the students’ core committee members should identify with the developmental psychopathology approach.

**Other Activities**

Students should attend talks (e.g., department colloquia, conferences) that permit further application of the developmental psychopathology framework.

Many of these experiences are easily achieved within the department and through consultation with students’ mentors. Criteria for the Developmental Psychopathology concentration are intended to be flexible, and it is expected that students will meet these criteria in a variety of different ways. If you have questions about this concentration, please contact [ddrabick@temple.edu](mailto:ddrabick@temple.edu).

## Social Psychology

Our program in Social Psychology focuses on decision making and implicit cognition. Students will gain a broad knowledge of psychology in general through coursework and a detailed knowledge of social psychological research by working in Dr. Hantula’s Decision Making Lab and/or Dr. Karpinski’s Cognition and Implicit Attitude (The Temple CIA) lab. Students in our program receive training in multiple research methods and advanced statistical techniques.

For more details, prospective applicants are encouraged to explore the web pages of social faculty to get a closer look at the research topics that are currently being investigated. A strong fit between an applicant’s research interests and those of a specific social faculty member is a very important aspect of the admissions process.

## CUDCP Policy

### Information for Applicants

The [Council of University Directors of Clinical Training](http://www.cudcp.us/) has adopted the following guidelines for offers into doctoral clinical psychology programs. If you are applying to a CUDCP program, you should expect the following policies will apply:

- In most CUDCP programs, a subset of applicants will be invited for an interview. Within a few weeks of the final interview dates, applicants will be notified regarding the status of their application. You may be offered admission, declined admission, placed on a wait list, or in some cases, a decision has not yet been reached regarding your application.

- Training programs will notify students no longer being considered for admission as soon as possible. In some cases, this information is communicated by the university graduate school and can take several weeks to be processed. In some cases, you may be able to get updated information on the status of the application process (e.g., whether all interview invites have been extended; whether all offers have been extended), on a clinical program’s website, or by contacting a program administrator. Beware of information posted on student-focused online forums that may be inaccurate or incomplete.

- Offers of admission can be extended during a large time period. Most initial offers of admission are extended by April 1. Offers may be communicated by phone or email, but should be followed up by a written confirmation within 48 hours.

- You should not be pressured, nor feel compelled to accept an offer of admission before April 15! This applies to offers of admission and to funding offers that accompany admission. It is impermissible for programs to request a decision prior to April 15 or to indicate that funding will be available only if students make decisions earlier than this date. Violations of this policy should be reported to CUDCP immediately (http://cudcp.us/contact.html) and your identity will be protected. Of course, it is permissible for you to accept an offer as soon as you are certain of your decision (i.e., even before April 15). But the decision to do so should be based on you, and not due to pressure placed upon you by a training program.
 
- Do not hold more than two offers for more than one week unless there is specific information (e.g., a visit is scheduled, funding decisions) you are waiting to receive from the program. Difficulty making up one’s mind is not considered an adequate excuse to limit the options available to other applicants.

- Once you have accepted an offer of admission to a training program, you should inform all programs in which you are still being considered. Be sure to inform programs either that you are declining outstanding offers of admission or you no longer wish to be considered for admission.
