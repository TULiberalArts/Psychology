## Leaders In Our Field

Our 38 full-time faculty members have won many national and international awards and are experienced leaders in their fields. Their research teams are addressing questions at the forefront of psychological science.

## Advising At Every Step

The dedicated academic advisor for Psychology is available to meet with students to provide guidance on course selection, acquiring an internship or research experience, career options, and applying to graduate school.

## Program Overview

The Department of Psychology has a strong commitment to scholarly and scientific excellence. It has been heralded as one of the most diverse universities in the nation. This setting offers exciting opportunities for research and scholarly discourse.

The Temple University Undergraduate Psychology program provides a modern curriculum covering a breadth of content, ranging from biological bases of cognition and behavior to sociocultural influences on human interactions and psychological disorders. The curriculum is designed to develop students’ critical thinking skills through emphasis of the scientific basis of Psychology and courses in statistics and research methodology. The program also emphasizes the integration and synthesis of information across courses and activities through the stepwise progression of the curriculum from the introductory, foundational, and advanced classes up to the final capstone course that is taken in the senior year.

Students are strongly encouraged to develop applied skills through rigorous and highly focused experiential learning in research laboratories and community–based internships. The curriculum is designed to be sufficiently flexible to satisfy the diversity of needs among undergraduates. As such an individually tailored curriculum may be selected for the purpose of preparing students for employment or further study in psychology, neuroscience, medicine, law, business, or other fields.
