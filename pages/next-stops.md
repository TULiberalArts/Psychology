## Where Can a Degree in Psychology Take You?
![Your Career]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Your Career sign.png){:.img-left}
Getting your psychology education is about more than getting your psychology degree. It’s about preparing for your future. Because the knowledge and skills you’ll learn as an undergraduate Psychology major (e.g., critical thinking, human behavior) are crucial to many disciplines, you’ll find yourself with a multitude of career and graduate study opportunities upon graduation. Psychology majors are often employed in management positions, real estate, sales, marketing, social services and labor relations. Many psychology majors also go on to graduate study in psychology or other fields, including law, medicine and business school.

The formal course [Careers in Psychology](http://bulletin.temple.edu/search/?P=PSY%201002) teaches Temple Psychology students about their career options and provides advice for career decisions. This course encourages students to begin preparing for their career early during their undergraduate training so that they may maximally benefit from their undergraduate education.

Examples of internship settings include:
- Abington Memorial Hospital
- Children’s Crisis Treatment Center
- Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia
- Kidsville Learning Center
- PeopleShare
- The Social Enrichment Center
- Tuttleman Counseling Services<br>
