## Where Can a Degree in Psychology Take You?
![Your Career]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Your Career sign.png){:.responsive-img .img-left}
Getting your psychology education is about more than getting your psychology degree. It’s about preparing for your future. With the knowledge and skills you’ll learn as an undergraduate Psychology major (e.g., critical thinking, understanding human behavior) you will find yourself with a multitude of career and graduate study opportunities upon graduation. Psychology majors often go into careers involving research, human resources, education, marketing, social services, or healthcare. Many psychology majors also go on to graduate study in psychology or other fields, including counseling, law, medicine, occupational or speech therapy, or business.

The formal course [Careers in Psychology](https://bulletin.temple.edu/search/?search=careers+in+psychology) teaches Temple Psychology majors about their career options. This course, designed to be taken by students in their first year as a psychology major, introduces students to the various career and graduate school options that are available to them after graduation.

Another valuable option comes through our **Psychology Internship and Practicum** courses, which provide placements in the Philadelphia and often provide valuable opportunities to develop workplace connections and skills.
