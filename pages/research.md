## Getting Involved in Research
![Olino Lab]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Olino lab.jpg){:.img-right}
Graduate programs in psychology highly regard students with research experience. At Temple you have the opportunity to volunteer in labs representing a wide range of psychological interests. Many of the faculty pages link to lab websites where you can learn more about their research. If you want to volunteer in a particular lab, email the faculty member to inquire if there are openings for a research volunteer.

Another opportunity to carry out research is through the [Psychology Honors Program]("resources/#honors-psychology-program") in which students carry out a focused research project and present it at the end of their senior year at a departmental poster session.
