## Big Questions, Vital Answers
At the heart of our program is our award-winning faculty. Nationally recognized scientists and practicing psychologists investigate how people think, feel, and develop using state-of-the-art methods in behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, and clinical, developmental and social psychology.

Research is conducted in our world-renowned laboratories that address a wide-range of human conditions and behavior. There are many opportunities for students to participate in faculty research or conduct independent study under faculty supervision.

## Temple University Labs 

### Mood and Cognition
What are the causes of the first onset of depression and bipolar disorder in adolescents and young adults? Are there factors that can provide protection  against depression and bipolar disorder? This lab, led by principal investigator **[Lauren Alloy](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/alloy-lauren)**, studies the cognitive, psychosocial, developmental, and, recently, neurobiological processes in the onset and course of depression and bipolar disorder in adolescents and adults.

### Neurocognition
How does working memory affect our daily lives? How do working memory and cognitive control operate and can they be improved? How do they change as people mature from pre-adolescence into adulthood? This lab, led by principal investigator **[Jason Chein](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/chein-jason)**, researches basic mechanisms of working memory and cognitive control; how to train working memory and cognitive control; and the development of cognitive control and its impact on adolescent decision-making.

### Child Health and Behavior
How can a disadvantaged youth improve his or her chances for success? Do family, peers, and neighborhood play a role? Under the direction of **[Deborah Drabick](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/drabick-deborah)**, this lab identifies factors associated with risk or resilience for emotional and behavioral problems among disadvantaged youth. The lab has a program to help youth improve their emotion regulation, problem-solving skills, and interpersonal behavior. 

### Determinants of Major Psychopathology
What factors contribute to risk for mental disorders? In the Determinants of Major Psychopathology Lab (DMPL), **[Lauren Ellman](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/ellman-lauren)** and her students investigate the environmental and biological contributions to development  of schizophrenia and related disorders, such as other psychotic disorders and depression. As understanding of disorder trajectories increases, so does the potential for earlier identification and treatment of at-risk individuals.

### Cognitive Neuropsychology
What happens to a person’s ability to do everyday tasks following brain damage or disease? What determines error detection and correction in everyday life? The goals of the Cognitive Neuropsychology Laboratory at Temple University, led by **[Tania Giovannetti](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/giovannetti-tania)**, are to develop and refine our understanding of the neurocognitive processes necessary for optimal everyday functioning in healthy people; understand the breakdown of everyday functioning following brain damage or disease; and develop and evaluate  
rehabilitation strategies.

### Developmental Science
How do infants and children begin to understand the social world? This lab group researches the development of the brain processes involved in social understanding  and interaction with others. Under the direction of **[Peter Marshall](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/marshall-peter-j)**, the lab examines links between action production and action perception, and how one’s own action capacities influence the way in which the actions of others are perceived and responded to.

### Mechanisms Of Affect Dysregulation
How do we control our emotions? What causes sudden bursts of aggression and how can we manage anger? This lab considers biological, psychological (cognitive-affective), and environmental mechanisms underlying difficulties in affect regulation (control of one’s emotional  state). The lab, under the direction of **[Michael McCloskey](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/mccloskey-michael)**, conducts a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging studies among individuals with and without difficulties  
in affect dysregulation.

### Cognitive Neuroscience
How does memory relate to people establishing successful relationships with society? How is it connected to abstract concepts such as “truth,” decision making, and development? Under the direction of **[Ingrid Olson](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/olson-ingrid)**, this lab studies neural structure-function relationships, especially in regard to episodic memory networks and social perception networks. The lab conducts experiments that use non-invasive brain stimulation techniques and treats memory dysfunction.

### Temple Infant And Child Lab
How do infants and children discover the world around them? Researchers at this lab examine cognitive development in infants and children, aged two months to 10 years. Directed by **[Kathryn Hirsh-Pasek](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/hirsh-pasek-kathryn)** and **[Nora Newcombe](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/newcombe-nora)**, the lab conducts cutting-edge research on spatial development, memory, language development, reading, school readiness, and the role of play and creativity in learning—moving from science to practice.

### Neurochemistry and Cognition
![Neurochemistry and Cognition Lab]({{site.baseurl}}/media/cropped Parikh Lab.jpg){:.img-right}
Why do some people—but not all—develop dementia and Alzheimer’s disease? How does drug use affect executive function? This lab studies the neurochemistry of cognitive processes, specifically those involved in attention and executive functions. Cognitive impairments are a big part of neuropsychiatric and age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Under the direction of **[Vinay Parikh](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/parikh-vinay)**, this lab examines neurochemical causes of the cognitive dysfunction associated with these pathologies.

### Adolescent Development and Decision-Making 
Why do teens engage in risky behavior? Is it driven by peer pressure or a simple lack of maturity? Is there something else at play? This lab, directed by **[Laurence Steinberg](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/steinberg-laurence)**, studies various aspects of adolescent development and decision-making, with a special focus on understanding why adolescents often engage in risky and reckless behavior. The lab uses a variety of methods, including behavioral tests, brain imaging, and questionnaires.

## Temple University Clinics

### Adult Anxiety
What is social anxiety and why should an adult seek treatment? How effective are current treatments? Directed by **[Richard Heimberg](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/heimberg-richard)**, the Adult Anxiety Clinic of Temple (AACT) provides evidence-based treatment for adults. In collaboration with other clinical scientists, the AACT also studies the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral and other therapies for social anxiety disorder as well  as methods to help patients overcome anxiety about visiting the dentist.

### Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders
Different treatments for anxiety disorders in youth may have different success rates. Which treatments are more effective than others and for whom? This clinic uses and evaluates comprehensive approaches to treat anxiety in children and adolescents—individual treatment, family treatment, brief treatment, and computer-assisted programs—to further knowledge, assessment, and treatment of anxiety and related disorders in youth. **[Philip C. Kendall](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/kendall-philip-c)** is principal investigator and director of the clinic.

### Psychological Services
The Psychological Services Center, under the direction of **[Catherine Panzarella](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/panzarella-catherine)**, is a nonprofit community center providing counseling, psychological services, and comprehensive psychological assessments. It serves individuals from Temple University and the surrounding communities. The PSC is a training clinic for the doctoral students in the Clinical Psychology Program, one of the top clinical  psychology doctoral programs in the country. Among the faculty are leading  researchers in the fields of depression and anxiety disorders.
