### Child Health and Behavior
How can a disadvantaged youth improve his or her chances for success? Do family, peers and neighborhood play a role? Under the direction of **[Deborah Drabick](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/drabick-deborah)**, this lab identifies factors associated with risk or resilience for emotional and behavioral problems among disadvantaged youths. The lab has a program to help youths improve their emotion regulation, problem-solving skills and interpersonal behavior. 

### Determinants of Major Psychopathology
What factors contribute to risk for mental disorders? In the Determinants of Major Psychopathology Lab (DMPL), **[Lauren Ellman](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/ellman-lauren)** and her students investigate the environmental and biological contributions to development  of schizophrenia and related disorders, such as other psychotic disorders and depression. As understanding of disorder trajectories increases, so does the potential for earlier identification and treatment of at-risk individuals.

### Neuroendocrinology & Behavior Laboratory
![NBL Lab]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Bangasser Lab.jpg){:.img-right}
The Neuroendocrinology and Behavior Laboratory, directed by **[Debra Bangasser](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/bangasser-debra)**, investigates the neurobiological underpinnings of vulnerability and resilience to stress and stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Because women are twice as likely to suffer from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder as men, a major goal of the NBL is to identify sex differences in stress responses systems that underlie female susceptibility to stress and these stress-related disorders. To this end, techniques from behavioral neuroscience, neuroendocrinology and cellular and molecular biology are employed to link molecular sex differences within stress circuits to sex specific changes in arousal, attention and cognition following stress.

### Neurochemistry and Cognition
![Neurochemistry and Cognition Lab]({{site.baseurl}}/media/cropped Parikh Lab.jpg){:.img-right}
Why do some older adults—but not all— develop dementia and Alzheimer’s disease? How do neurocognitive changes shape maladaptive drug-taking behaviors in addicts? Under the direction of **[Vinay Parikh](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/parikh-vinay)**, this lab investigates cellular and neurochemical circuit mechanisms that maintain cognitive processes, specifically those involved in attention and executive functions and how these mechanisms are affected by aging/pathological aging and exposure to drugs of abuse. The lab utilizes a combination of neuroscientific approaches including rodent behavioral paradigms, in vivo electrochemical recordings, genetic manipulations and protein biochemistry.

## Behavioral Neurophysiology Lab
![Behavioral Neurophysiology Lab]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Briand+Lab+Photo+copy.jpg){:.img-right}
Why do some people who experiment drugs of abuse go on to become addicts? Why is it so hard for individuals with substance use disorder to quit? The Behavioral Neurophysiology Lab, directed by **[Lisa Briand](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/briand-lisa)**, studies the neurobiological underpinnings of vulnerability to addiction. Early life stress experience increases vulnerability to substance use and one goal of our work in the lab is to understand the molecular and electrophysiological changes underlying this increase. To answer these questions, we utilize behavioral neuroscience, cellular and molecular biology, and optogenetic and electrophysiological techniques.

### Adolescent Development and Decision-Making 
Why do teens engage in risky behavior? Is it driven by peer pressure or a simple lack of maturity? Is there something else at play? This lab, directed by **[Laurence Steinberg](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/steinberg-laurence)**, studies various aspects of adolescent development and decision-making with a special focus on understanding why adolescents often engage in risky and reckless behavior. The lab uses a variety of methods, including behavioral tests, brain imaging and questionnaires.

### Adolescent Social Adjustment
What factors contribute to the psychological well-being of economically disadvantaged, ethnic minority adolescents? In the Adolescent Social Adjustment lab, **[Ronald Taylor](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/taylor-ronald)** and his students examine how family and kin relations, neighborhood conditions and family economic resources are linked to the social and emotional adjustment of urban, disadvantaged, ethnic minority youths. This lab also studies how family and kin and socio-economic factors are associated with the college adjustment of ethnic minority students.

### Temple Cognition and Learning Lab
Why do some children start school with strong math skills and some don't? Why do some people love math, and some fear it? What are the developmental, cognitive and emotional processes that lead to successful math learning? This lab, directed by **[Elizabeth Gunderson](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/gunderson-elizabeth)**, investigates mathematical development from cognitive and socio-emotional perspectives, including topics such as numerical development, parenting practices that promote math learning and motivation, the relation between spatial and numerical skills and the development of math anxieties and stereotypes.

## Adaptive Memory Lab
![Adaptive Memory Lab]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Adaptive Memory Lab.png){:.img-right}
The Adaptive Memory Lab **[(PI: Murty)](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/murty-vishnu)** focuses on how engagement of neuromodulatory systems, particularly the mesolimbic dopamine system, influences memory and memory-guided behavior in order to help individuals’ achieve their goals. We investigate these systems in a variety of affective and motivational states including reward, novelty and threat. Additionally, we probe these systems in individuals with or at-risk for psychosis to better understand the role of episodic memory in adaptive behavior.
