## Program Overview
![Behavior Lab]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized Behavior-Lab-3.jpg){:.img-right}

The largest doctoral program in the College of Liberal Arts, the Psychology Department offers concentrations in Clinical Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and Social Psychology. Graduate students have the opportunity to participate in an interdisciplinary program in Developmental Psychopathology and an interdisciplinary certificate program in Neuroscience.

Students interested in receiving a Specialization in Neuroscience through the Neuroscience Program should visit the [Neuroscience Program Website](http://www.cla.temple.edu/neuroscience/).

## Programs of Study
The department of psychology has four areas of study in the doctoral program:

- [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://www.cla.temple.edu/psychology/graduate/brain-and-cognitive-sciences)<br>
- [Clinical Psychology](https://www.cla.temple.edu/psychology/graduate/clinical-psychology)<br>
- [Developmental Psychology](https://www.cla.temple.edu/psychology/graduate/developmental-psychology)<br>
- [Social Psychology](https://www.cla.temple.edu/psychology/graduate/social-psychology)<br>

Students are ultimately accepted into specific programs. However, all PhD applicants must meet the requirements for admission. Please visit the [Psychology Graduate Admissions page](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/admissions/graduate/psychology) to learn more about graduate program requirements, dates and deadlines and instructions on how to apply.

## Careers
Individuals earning PhD degrees in Psychology have moved on to a variety of interesting and fulfilling positions. We have been consistently successful in placing our graduates in the types of positions they were hoping to obtain. Currently, it is typical for most individuals with newly earned Psychology PhD degrees to go on to postdoctoral research positions, and this holds for our students. Many of our graduates secure prestigious postdoctoral positions where they bring their skills and knowledge to the highest levels. Many of those students then obtain faculty positions at well-known institutions, where they carry out cutting-edge research in diverse areas from behavioral neuroscience to clinical science. Other students obtain research positions in various industries.
