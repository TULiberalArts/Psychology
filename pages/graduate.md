## FAQ about the Psychology Graduate Program

- _**Does the Psychology Department offer a master’s degree?**_

No. All students are accepted and enrolled in our full-time Ph.D. program in psychology.

-**Does the Psychology Department accept part-time students?**__
No, we do not. The graduate program is a full-time program.

-_**Can you send me information about your program and an application packet in the mail?**_

We are no longer sending program information and application materials out by mail. All available information about our graduate program and the application process – including all necessary application materials and forms – can be accessed directly from our website – the very one you’re on right now. There is no additional information available to be sent to you.

***- I am interested in applying to your program and was wondering whether it would be convenient for me to make a visit to the campus and possibly meet a graduate student or professor before I send in my application.**

In light of the large number of applications we receive each year, we typically are unable to grant requests for interviews and in-person meetings prior to the invited admissions interviews. However, you should feel free to email one or more of our faculty members with whom you might be interested in working and let them know of your interest or ask them a question if you’d like. Of course, if you are in the area you can certainly stop by and look around the campus, but we will generally not be able to set up appointments for you to meet with students or faculty. If you do apply and are one of the applicants invited to participate in one of our interview days, typically in January, you will have ample opportunity to meet with faculty and graduate students at that time.

- _**Do you have an Open House for prospective graduate students?**_

We do not conduct any open houses or informational sessions for our program. Instead, we invite approximately 80 applicants to attend interview days in January and February.

- _**Do any additional forms need to be submitted in order for an applicant to be considered for a research or teaching assistantship or for other forms of financial assistance?**_

No, there are no such additional forms. We do not accept students into our program without funding them. Every offer of admission comes with an assistantship or fellowship attached, which includes full tuition remission and health care benefit, so applying for admission is all you need to do. If you are invited to come for an interview, we will explain the specific forms of funding available to you in more detail during your visit.

- _**Is it possible to find out which faculty in the psychology graduate program will be accepting students for the upcoming year?**_

The exact distribution changes from year to year, but most faculty members will plan to accept at least one student each year, and some more than one. Furthermore, each faculty member’s situation can change somewhat as we go through the process. However, we indicate on our site any faculty members who do not plan to accept students for a given year. If you are interested in our program, we encourage you to go ahead and apply. If your interest is very specific to one or two faculty members, the best thing to do is contact those faculty and ask them directly how many students they hope to accept for next year.

- _**Do you require the GRE Advanced (i.e., GRE Psychology) test?**_

We do not require it, but we do encourage it under certain circumstances. It is particularly important if you are applying to our program and have little background in psychology, because we find it useful under those circumstances to know how familiar you are with basic concepts in psychology. If you do have a background in psychology and have submitted a score on the advanced test, we will consider your score as part of the overall application package.

- _**How many applications do you get each year, and how many students do you accept?**_

It varies from year to year. In recent years we have received between 450 and 550 applications, from which we typically accept approximately 40 students. Our entering classes each year are approximately 20 students. Of our applications, approximately 75% are in Clinical, with the rest split evenly among the other areas. Of our entering classes, 50% (10 students) are Clinical students, with the rest split among the other areas. The BCS, Developmental, and Social areas typically admit 3-5 students per year.

- _**What are the average credentials of accepted applicants?**_

The credentials are strong: GREs are typically above the 75th percentile, undergraduate GPAs are in the range 3.35 – 4.0, and many admitted students have research experience and publications.

- _**What is the process once my application packet is complete?**_

Completed applications are reviewed by the faculty members in the area to which you have applied. Each faculty member rates the application merit and potential fit to the program, as well as to the individual faculty member’s program of research. Based on those ratings, we select applicants to invite for on-campus interviews. We typically hold our admissions interviews in late January.

- _**I have checked my Temple application, and it said I was missing the documents that I submitted through Interfolio. Does that mean that my application is not being considered?**_

Your Interfolio account is not linked to your application to the Graduate School at Temple. Therefore, after you send your documents through Interfolio, your Temple Graduate School application may list missing documents (i.e., those submitted through Interfolio). Do not be concerned, as this is a procedural matter only. If your application is missing any necessary documents, we will contact you. No one will be rejected because of missing documents. If you do not hear from us requesting any information, then you can rest assured that your application is complete.

- _**If I am unable to make it to Philadelphia for an interview, can I do a phone interview instead? How would this affect my chances of admission?**_

We do not encourage or conduct phone interviews on a routine basis. If you are invited for an interview and are seriously interested in our program, we would urge you to make every effort to be here for one of our interview days. However, we do recognize that sometimes it just isn’t possible for a candidate to arrange travel to Philadelphia for either of our dates, especially given the short time frame within which we must work. If you absolutely cannot make it, we will try to arrange for you to speak with one or two faculty members and graduate student over the phone. We cannot make a blanket statement about how this would affect your chances of admission, because each case is unique. However, it is certainly in your best interest to make every effort to interview in person.

- _**Will I be notified if I am not going to be invited for an interview?**_

Once we have selected the applicants to whom we are offering interviews, we will contact them directly by email, typically in early to mid January. All other applicant files are sent to the Graduate School, which in turn will notify those applicants that they will not be receiving offers of admission. Since this process typically takes several weeks at least, applicants who have not been invited to interview will not likely be informed of such by the Graduate School until some time after all interviews are granted and admissions offers have been extended. However, if you have not heard from us by the end of January, please feel free to email the Head of the area to which you have applied to check on your status. We should be able to tell you at that time whether or not you will be invited for an interview. Please do not call the Psychology Department or the Graduate School for updates on your status.

- _**Do I need to have an undergraduate major in psychology or neuroscience to apply to your program?**_

No, although you must have taken coursework in these areas. More information is available in the application requirements.

- _**Can I apply to your program if I already have a master’s degree from somewhere else?**_

Yes.

- _**Will my graduate credits from another program transfer?**_

Sometimes yes, sometimes no. We evaluate this on a case-by-case system. A maximum of nine credits can be transferred.

- _**My interests span multiple areas. To which area should I apply?**_

You should contact individual faculty members or area directors to seek their advice.

- _**Should I contact individual faculty members to see if my research interests fit into their research program, or to see if they are taking students?**_

Yes.

## Careers

Individuals earning Ph.D. degrees in Psychology have moved on to a variety of interesting and fulfilling positions. We have been consistently successful in placing our graduates in the types of positions they were hoping to obtain. At the present time, it is typical for most individuals with newly-earned Psychology Ph.D. degrees to go on to postdoctoral research positions, and this holds for our students as well. Many of our graduates secure prestigious postdoctoral positions, where they bring their skills and knowledge to the highest levels. Many of those students then obtain faculty positions at well-known institutions, where they carry out cutting-edge research in diverse areas from behavioral neuroscience to clinical science. Other students obtain research positions in industry.
