## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Mission
To develop and promote strategies and best practices to increase diversity, equity and inclusion within the Department of Psychology and across our field. We strive to promote inclusive research, scholarship and leadership by fostering a diverse and equitable educational experience. 

**DEI Faculty Members:**<br>
Lisa Brand, Eunice Chen (Committee Chair), Tania Giovannetti, Deepu Murty, Sandra Sepulveda-Kozakowski, Ronald Taylor and Mathieu Wimmer. Graduate student representatives collaborate with us.

## DEI Initiatives
Faculty are working together on these 4 initiatives to achieve the following goals: 

### Psychology Graduate Students for Inclusivity (PGSI)
PGSI is a graduate student group aimed at promoting diversity and inclusivity in the Psychology Department through several arms and initiatives. For example, the PGSI Undergraduate Arm connects with Temple undergraduates through various channels (e.g., RAs in labs, Psychology Majors Association, Careers in Psychology course) to encourage and support students from diverse backgrounds in our department. This arm also supports recruitment and retention of students from diverse backgrounds to the Temple Psychology graduate program, including organizing summer and school year programs for undergraduates who may be interested in graduate school. Undergraduate students seeking mentoring from PGSI graduate students should contact PGSI representatives at [tupsychmentorship@gmail.com](mailto:tupsychmentorship@gmail.com).

### Ongoing Research Related to DEI
[TEDp (Temple Eating Disorders program)](https://sites.temple.edu/tedp/diversity/). Our work has addressed issues regarding obesity stigma and also the relationship between gender and eating disordered behavior. Our most recent clinical trial using imaging recruited primarily African-American women. Our recent work with colleagues in our department (Ronald Taylor and Mike McCloskey) also examine racial diversity in neuroimaging studies.
