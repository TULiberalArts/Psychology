### FAQ about the BCS Program

- _**Do you offer a terminal Master’s degree?”**_

No, we do not.

- _**I’m interested in neuropsychology (e.g. assessment of individuals with brain lesions). Should I apply to your program?”**_

The BCS area does not specialize in neuropsychology so it would be best to apply elsewhere.

- _**“What is the difference between the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Area of the Psychology Department, the Neuroscience program through CLA, and the Neuroscience Department through Temple’s medical school?”**_

The Department of Neuroscience at Temple University Medical School specializes in four interdisciplinary research areas: neurodegeneration, neuroinfection, neuroinflammation and neuromalignancy. Students with specific interests in those areas of research should contact the Department of Neuroscience in the School of Medicine. The Brain and Cognitive Sciences Area of the Psychology Department has several faculty with research programs in neuroscience areas. Graduate Students in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Area of the Psychology Department will receive a Ph.D. in Psychology upon successful completion of degree requirements. The Program in Neuroscience in the College of Liberal Arts offers a Specialization in Neuroscience that is open to all graduate students in any department/college of Temple University. Upon successful completion of program requirements, students’ transcripts reflect a Ph.D. in their home department and in Neuroscience. For example, a psychology graduate student that completes the Specialization will receive a Ph.D. in Psychology and Neuroscience.

- _**“Do I need to take the psychology GRE to apply?”**_

No.

- _**“Can I apply even if my general GRE scores are below the specified minimum?”**_

We require verbal and quantitative GRE scores. On the new GRE, the minimum scores are 153 verbal, 151 quantitative, and 305 total.  On the old GRE, the minimum scores are 500 verbal, 650 quantitative, and 1150 total GRE.  The GRE Subject Exam in Psychology is optional. Please have your GRE scores sent to Temple University electronically by ETS; our code is 2906. Applicants with GRE scores below these minima, but who can provide other evidence of strong academic credentials, will be seriously considered. We accept GRE scores up to five years after the test was taken. Applicants with GRE scores older than 5 years should re-take the test.

- _**Do I need to have an undergraduate major in psychology or neuroscience to apply to your program?”**_

No, although you must have taken coursework in these areas.

- _**“Can I apply to your program if I already have a master’s degree from somewhere else?”**_

Yes.

- _**“Will my graduate credits from another program transfer?”**_

Sometimes yes, sometimes no. We evaluate this on a case-by-case system.

- _**“I applied to your program. How do I know if I was granted an interview?”**_

You will be contacted no later than March 1 by email or telephone if you were granted an interview.

- _**“My interests span BCS, Developmental, and Clinical areas. To which area should I apply?”**_

You should contact individual faculty members to seek their advice.

- _**“I am interested in the Decision Neuroscience Program. Should I apply through Psychology?”**_

The program is currently being coordinated through the Fox School of Business at Temple. Please click here for more information.

You should contact individual faculty members to seek their advice.

## Clinical Psychology

The Clinical Psychology Program at Temple University subscribes to the clinical scientist model and provides sound, rigorous training in clinical and research methodologies. The overarching mission of the program is to train creative and accomplished clinical scientists who produce, consume, and disseminate psychological science and who function successfully in academic, research, and applied settings. Doctoral students receive broad-based training in preparation for careers as researchers, educators, and scientifically minded clinicians. Coursework provides students with a solid theoretical and scientific foundation in the core areas of psychology and essential aspects of clinical psychology.

Students are immersed in the conduct of research in clinical psychology and its application to the assessment and treatment of persons with mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Many of our students conduct research with applied emphases, and they are encouraged to incorporate empirical research directly into their assessment, intervention, and treatment planning. For graduates who choose an academically or research-oriented career path, it is our goal that their research endeavors be informed by a fundamental understanding of basic psychological science, including psychopathology and a solid foundation of clinical skill and experience in the assessment and treatment of persons with psychological, emotional, and behavioral disorders.

For students who go on to do work that is more clinical in nature, our goal is that these graduates not only bring excellence, professionalism, and leadership to their clinical work, but that they do so within a scientific framework. As we define it, this means that they bring the perspectives and habits of scientific inquiry into their clinical work and that their work is continually informed by advances in the scientific literature. To accomplish these goals, Temple students are directly involved in both research and clinical training throughout their tenure, beginning in their very first year.

The Clinical Psychology Program is fully accredited by the Psychological Clinical Science Accreditation System (PCSAS) and the American Psychological Association (APA).

### Goals of Clinical Psychology

The goals of the clinical psychology Ph.D. training program are:

Goal 1. Develop clinical psychologists who have a broad understanding of the knowledge base and theoretical and methodological foundations in psychology, and more specifically, in the field of clinical psychology.

Goal 2. Develop clinical psychologists who possess the knowledge and skills to conduct high quality and ethical research and make meaningful contributions to the empirical and theoretical literature in clinical psychology.

Goal 3. Develop clinical psychologists who are competent in the practice of clinical psychology and are skilled in the ethical application of empirically supported principles and techniques of assessment and intervention in their professional activities.

Goal 4. Develop clinical psychologists who seek to integrate science and practice in their research and clinical activities.

The overarching goal of the program is to train creative and competent scientists and practitioners who are producers and consumers of knowledge in psychological science and will be competent to function successfully in academic, research, and clinical settings.  Some of our students go on to do work that is largely clinical in nature upon completion of their degrees.  It is our goal that these graduates not only bring excellence, professionalism, and leadership to their clinical work, but that they do so within a scientific framework.  As we define it, this means that they bring the perspectives and habits of scientific inquiry into their clinical work and that their work is continually informed by advances in the scientific literature.  For instance, these graduates should be well versed in the application of empirically supported treatments for psychological, emotional and behavioral disorders. Likewise, for the increasing numbers of graduates who choose an academically or research-oriented career path, it is our goal that their research endeavors are informed by a fundamental understanding of psychopathology and a solid foundation of clinical skill and experience in the assessment and treatment of persons with psychological, emotional and behavioral disorders.  To accomplish these goals, Temple students are directly involved in both research and clinical training throughout their tenure, beginning in their very first year.

### Clinical Psychology FAQ

- _**Does the Psychology Department offer a master’s program in clinical psychology?**_

No, we do not offer a terminal master’s program in clinical psychology.  All clinical students must be accepted and enrolled in our full-time Ph.D. program in clinical psychology.

- _**Does the Psychology Department accept part-time clinical students?**_

No, we do not.  The clinical program and its training experiences are only open to full-time, non-working doctoral students enrolled in the Psychology Department’s Ph.D. program.

- _**Can you send me information about your program and an application packet in the mail?**_

We are no longer sending program information and application materials out by mail. All available information about our graduate program and the application process – including all necessary application materials and forms – can be accessed directly from our website – the very one you’re on right now. There is no additional information available to be sent to you.

- _**I am interested in applying to your program and was wondering whether it would be convenient for me to make a visit to the campus and possibly meet a graduate student or professor before I send in my application?**_

In light of the large number of applications we receive each year, we are unable to grant requests for interviews and in-person meetings prior to the invited admissions interviews. However, you should feel free to email one or more of our faculty members with whom you might be interested in working and let them know of your interest or ask them a question if you’d like. Of course, if you are in the area you can certainly stop by and look around the campus, but we will generally not be able to set up appointments for you to meet with students or faculty. If you do apply and are one of the approximately 60-70 applicants invited to participate in one of our interview days in late January, you will have ample opportunity to meet with faculty and graduate students at that time.

- _**Do you have an Open House for prospective graduate students?**_

No, we don’t conduct any open houses or informational sessions for our program. Instead, we invite approximately 60-70 applicants to attend one of our two interview days in late January.

- _**Do any additional forms need to be submitted in order to be considered for a research or teaching assistantship or for other forms of financial assistance?**_

No, there are no such additional forms. We do not accept students into our program without funding them. Every offer of admission comes with an assistantship or fellowship attached, which includes full tuition remission, stipend, and health care benefit, so applying for admission is all you need to do. If you are invited to come for an interview, we will explain the specific forms of funding available to you in more detail during your visit.

- _**Is it possible to find out which faculty in the clinical psychology graduate program will be accepting students in Fall 2017?**_

The exact distribution changes from year to year, but most faculty members will plan to accept at least one student each year, and some more than one. Furthermore, each faculty member’s situation can change somewhat as we go through the process. However, we will indicate on our site any faculty members who do not plan to accept students for 2017. If you are generally interested in our program, we encourage you to go ahead and apply. If your interest is very specific to one or two faculty members, and you do not see them listed as not planning to take a student next year, the best thing to do is contact faculty with whom you might be interested in working, and ask them directly how many students they hope to accept for next year.

- _**Does Temple’s clinical program have a child clinical track or specialization?**_

We do not offer a child track per se. However, in recognition of the department’s strengths in both the child clinical and developmental areas, as well as the growing interest in this field, we do offer something we call a developmental psychopathology concentration. It is not a formal program, and as such there are no specific requirements. It is rather a list of recommended courses and training experiences for students in either the clinical or developmental programs wishing to emphasize this aspect of their training. For more details please click [here](https://sites.google.com/a/temple.edu/psychology-department-test-site/graduate/developmental/developmental-psychopathology).

- _**Do you require the GRE Advanced (i.e., Psychology) test?**_

We do not require it, but we do encourage it. It is particularly important if you are applying to our program and have little background in psychology, because we find it useful under those circumstances to know how familiar you are with basic concepts in psychology. If you do have a background in psychology and have submitted a score on the advanced test, we will consider your score as part of the overall application package.

- _**How many applications do you get each year?**_

It varies from year to year. In recent years we have received around 400-500 applications. For example, in 2015 we received approximately 475 applications for the entering class, and we accepted 11 students.

- **_How many students do you accept?_**

That number varies from year to year as well, but generally lies somewhere around 9-12. We have not yet determined the exact number of students we can accept for the Fall 2017 incoming class, but we anticipate it being in that range.

- _**What is the process once my application packet is complete?**_

Completed applications for the clinical program are reviewed by the Clinical Admissions Director and members of the clinical faculty with whom you have indicated a strong interest in working. Each faculty member who reviews the application gives it a rating based on merit and potential fit to the program, as well as to the individual faculty member’s program of research. Based on those ratings, we will select approximately 60-70 applicants to invite for on-campus interviews. We hope to begin extending those invitations in early January. We hold all of our admissions interviews over a two-day period in late January.

- _**How many faculty members will evaluate my application?**_

Every application is reviewed and rated by at least the member of the clinical faculty ranked as your highest choice for potential mentor on the Graduate Data Sheet. In many cases, your second and third choice mentors will also review your application as well. Each faculty member then selects a group of applicants to invite for the on-campus interviews as potential students to work with. Therefore, it is important that you attend closely to potential interest overlap and fit to the mentor(s) you rank highest, as potential fit is an extremely important factor in determining your chances of being invited to interview.

- _**If I am unable to make it to Philadelphia for either of your interview days, can I do a phone or skype interview instead? How would this affect my chances of admission?**_

If you are invited for an interview and are seriously interested in our program, we would urge you to make every effort to be here for one of our interview days. We do not encourage or conduct phone or video conference interviews on a routine basis. However, we do recognize that sometimes it just isn’t possible for a candidate to arrange travel to Philadelphia for either of our dates, especially given the short time frame within which we must work. If you absolutely cannot make it, we will try to arrange for you to speak with one or two faculty members and graduate student over the phone or video conference. We cannot make a blanket statement about how this would affect your chances of admission, because each case is unique. We have accepted students who have interviewed in this way, but it is certainly in your best interest to make every effort to interview in person if you can.

- _**Will I be notified if I am not going to be invited for an interview?**_

Once we have selected the applicants to whom we are offering interviews, we will contact them directly by email, typically in early January. All other applicant files are sent to the Graduate School, which, in turn, will notify those applicants that they will not be receiving offers of admission. Since this process typically takes several weeks at least, applicants who have not been invited to interview will not likely be informed of such by the Graduate School until sometime after all interviews are granted and admissions offers have been extended. However, we will post an admissions update to the clinical program’s webpage once we have completed the process of extending all of our invitations for interviews, so that those who have not been contacted will know that an invitation will not be forthcoming. Please check the webpage around mid-January for that update. Please do not call the Psychology Department or the Graduate School for updates on your status. Instead, please monitor the clinical psychology program’s webpage for links to any admissions updates, or contact Dr. Robert Fauber by email at [rfauber@temple.edu](mailto:rfauber@temple.edu) if you require additional information.

## Developmental Psychology

The Developmental Psychology Area comprises a group of faculty and doctoral students who are addressing questions involving cognitive, social, or emotional development within and across various phases of the life cycle. The rationale for our graduate training program is the core assumption that the consideration of developmental processes is a invaluable part of understanding any psychological phenomenon.

Although developmental students often specialize in one phase of development and a particular content area, each student is encouraged to explore the general nature of the change process across the lifespan. With that goal in mind, developmental students take graduate courses on a variety of topics, including the option to pursue advanced statistical training.

Each student also works closely with a faculty advisor to develop a programmatic line of research which would provide a foundation for obtaining a postdoctoral position. There is a strong emphasis on presenting work at major academic conferences as well as publishing in top peer-reviewed journals.

For more details, prospective applicants are encouraged to explore the web pages of developmental faculty (below) to get a closer look at the research topics that are being explored across the area. Envisaging a good fit between an applicant’s research interests and those of a specific developmental faculty member is a very important aspect of the admissions process.

Students also have the option of taking a concentration in Developmental Psychopathology. Learn more about the concentration in Developmental Psychopathology.

**Developmental Psychopathology Concentration**

In recognition of the growing popularity of the area of developmental psychopathology, the department provides graduate students the option of pursuing a concentration in Developmental Psychopathology as part of their graduate training. The concentration in Developmental Psychopathology is neither a separate program nor a subdivision of any of the specific programs (e.g., clinical, developmental), but an approach to coursework, research, and other graduate activities that reflects a developmental psychopathology framework. There are a variety of ways that students can meet criteria for the Developmental Psychopathology concentration.

**Coursework**

All students interested in the Developmental Psychopathology concentration should meet the requirements of their individual programs and plan electives to ensure that the following courses are taken:

- developmental psychopathology
- core course in developmental psychology
- core course in psychopathology
- one additional elective in developmental psychology
- one additional elective in clinical psychology
- advanced statistics beyond multivariate regression

**Research**

Students’ independent research (e.g., dissertation) should reflect the application of a developmental psychopathology perspective in the research questions, methods, analytic approach, and interpretation of findings. At least one of the students’ core committee members should identify with the developmental psychopathology approach.

**Other Activities**

Students should attend talks (e.g., department colloquia, conferences) that permit further application of the developmental psychopathology framework.

Many of these experiences are easily achieved within the department and through consultation with students’ mentors. Criteria for the Developmental Psychopathology concentration are intended to be flexible, and it is expected that students will meet these criteria in a variety of different ways. If you have questions about this concentration, please contact [ddrabick@temple.edu](mailto:ddrabick@temple.edu).

## Social Psychology

Our program in Social Psychology focuses on decision making and implicit cognition. Students will gain a broad knowledge of psychology in general through coursework and a detailed knowledge of social psychological research by working in Dr. Hantula’s Decision Making Lab and/or Dr. Karpinski’s Cognition and Implicit Attitude (The Temple CIA) lab. Students in our program receive training in multiple research methods and advanced statistical techniques.

For more details, prospective applicants are encouraged to explore the web pages of social faculty to get a closer look at the research topics that are currently being investigated. A strong fit between an applicant’s research interests and those of a specific social faculty member is a very important aspect of the admissions process.

## CUDCP Policy

### Information for Applicants

The [Council of University Directors of Clinical Training](http://www.cudcp.us/) has adopted the following guidelines for offers into doctoral clinical psychology programs. If you are applying to a CUDCP program, you should expect the following policies will apply:

- In most CUDCP programs, a subset of applicants will be invited for an interview. Within a few weeks of the final interview dates, applicants will be notified regarding the status of their application. You may be offered admission, declined admission, placed on a wait list, or in some cases, a decision has not yet been reached regarding your application.

- Training programs will notify students no longer being considered for admission as soon as possible. In some cases, this information is communicated by the university graduate school and can take several weeks to be processed. In some cases, you may be able to get updated information on the status of the application process (e.g., whether all interview invites have been extended; whether all offers have been extended), on a clinical program’s website, or by contacting a program administrator. Beware of information posted on student-focused online forums that may be inaccurate or incomplete.

- Offers of admission can be extended during a large time period. Most initial offers of admission are extended by April 1. Offers may be communicated by phone or email, but should be followed up by a written confirmation within 48 hours.

- You should not be pressured, nor feel compelled to accept an offer of admission before April 15! This applies to offers of admission and to funding offers that accompany admission. It is impermissible for programs to request a decision prior to April 15 or to indicate that funding will be available only if students make decisions earlier than this date. Violations of this policy should be reported to CUDCP immediately (http://cudcp.us/contact.html) and your identity will be protected. Of course, it is permissible for you to accept an offer as soon as you are certain of your decision (i.e., even before April 15). But the decision to do so should be based on you, and not due to pressure placed upon you by a training program.
 
- Do not hold more than two offers for more than one week unless there is specific information (e.g., a visit is scheduled, funding decisions) you are waiting to receive from the program. Difficulty making up one’s mind is not considered an adequate excuse to limit the options available to other applicants.

- Once you have accepted an offer of admission to a training program, you should inform all programs in which you are still being considered. Be sure to inform programs either that you are declining outstanding offers of admission or you no longer wish to be considered for admission.
